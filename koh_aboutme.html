      <p>(COPIED AND PASTED NONSENSE)The few years I spent in Singapore were the first memories I was able to retain, and of those memories, the strongest are those with my brother. We argued and fought, but we always made up. Those years were a key part of my childhood, and when we moved to San Jose, change was everywhere, but only one thing stayed constant. My last memory of Singapore will forever be of me and Josh, at 4 am, the morning we left. Feeling unprepared to leave all of it behind, trying to absorb every small detail and every small liberty. Just me and Josh, cramming pandan bread into our mouths, trying to keep the taste of the home we would never return to.
